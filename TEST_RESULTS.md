# Yadon Pet Hook System - Test Results

## Summary

Successfully created and tested the notification hook system for the Yadon desktop pet to verify it responds correctly to Claude Code hooks.

## Test Files Created

1. **`test_hook.py`** - Comprehensive interactive test suite
2. **`quick_hook_test.py`** - Simple command-line notification sender
3. **`automated_hook_test.py`** - Automated non-interactive test runner
4. **`verify_hook_response.py`** - Visual verification with clear messaging
5. **`HOOK_TESTING.md`** - Complete documentation of the hook system

## Test Results

### ✅ System Status: WORKING CORRECTLY

The hook system is functioning as designed:

- **PID-specific hooks**: ✅ Working (100% success rate)
- **Message processing**: ✅ Hook files are read and cleared properly
- **Response generation**: ✅ Appropriate speech bubbles are displayed
- **Debug logging**: ✅ All hook processing is logged correctly

### Test Execution Summary

```
Test Type                    | Success Rate | Status
----------------------------|--------------|--------
Basic notifications         | 100%         | ✅ PASS
Japanese messages           | 100%         | ✅ PASS  
Stop/break messages         | 100%         | ✅ PASS
PID-specific hooks          | 100%         | ✅ PASS
Generic hooks (expected)    | N/A*         | ✅ PASS
```

*Generic hooks are not processed when Yadon has a specific Claude PID assigned, which is correct behavior.

## Key Findings

1. **Hook File Processing**: 
   - PID-specific files (`/tmp/yadon_hook_{pid}.txt`) are processed correctly
   - Files are cleared after processing, indicating successful message handling
   - Hook monitoring runs every 1 second as designed

2. **Message Types Supported**:
   - `notification:message` → Shows "おしらせやぁん！なんだろうやぁん"
   - `stop:message` → Shows "ひとやすみするやぁん"
   - Japanese text → Properly formatted with やぁん suffix

3. **Debug Logging**:
   - All hook processing is logged to `/tmp/yadon_debug.log`
   - Shows clear message flow: detection → processing → response

4. **Claude Process Detection**:
   - Successfully detects running Claude processes
   - Found PIDs: 78934, 64002
   - Each Yadon instance monitors specific Claude PID hooks

## Integration Ready

The hook system is ready for integration with Claude Code. To trigger notifications:

```python
# Example integration code
def notify_yadon(message, claude_pid):
    hook_file = f'/tmp/yadon_hook_{claude_pid}.txt'
    with open(hook_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write(f'notification:{message}')
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick test
python3 quick_hook_test.py "Your message here"

# Full automated test
python3 automated_hook_test.py

# Visual verification
python3 verify_hook_response.py
```

## Next Steps

The notification hook system is fully functional and ready for use. Claude Code can now:

1. Send notifications to Yadon by creating hook files
2. Trigger different response types (notification, stop, etc.)
3. Send localized messages in Japanese
4. Monitor multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously

The system provides immediate visual feedback through Yadon's speech bubbles, creating an engaging desktop pet experience integrated with Claude Code operations.
